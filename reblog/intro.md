# Bayesnets

## Welcome

Bayesnets is a mini-research project where we seek to look into neural nets by limiting scope in order to understand the deeper truths of neural networks.

For this project, we're mostly limiting ourselves to

- looking at the behaviour of many networks with only starting conditions affected
- simple 1d functions
- fully connected networks
- visualisations (with a heavy focus on animations) to drive intuition.


## Swarm

`swarm` is the python package of this repo you will see imported in the experiments. It contains utils
to do batches of training and animation as well as things like setting rng seeds. Browse the source
code here.

## Terminology

We use the below terminology for experiments/code.

- Bee : A neural net training sequence
- Swarm : A group of networks trained the same way, with the only difference defined by starting conditions
- Hive : A set of swarms with some some training/initialisation parameter varied.
